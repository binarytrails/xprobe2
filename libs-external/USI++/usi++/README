Purposes of the header-files
----------------------------

    o	<classname>.h	(arp.h etc.)	

         must be included by all programs that use <classname>
	 except they include usi++.h (which is old style)
	 It doesn't open the namespace usipp.

    o  usi++.h
	
	 this file contains all definitions which are needed
	 by programs using USI++. It is just for compatibility
	 purposes.
	 Opens namespace usipp.
	 
    o usi++
    
	 Makes the global functions visible: error-handling, checksum etc.
	 Users should do
	 
	 #include <usi++/usi++>
	 #include <usi++/arp.h>		// or whatever
	 using namespace usipp;
	 
	 to get the power of USI++ :)
	 
    o usi-structs.h
    
	For USI++ internal use. All cc-files from this lib include
	usi-structs.h because they'll find ip-struct etc. there.
	If you need a reliable declaration of such structs, you can also
	use usi-strcuts.h (coz on many OS' these strcuts are broken).
	After including usi-strcuts.h you almost don't need to include
	any other net-header as sys/socket.h or such.
	It's all putten into usipp-namespace which is not opened by
	usi-structs.h

	
All C++-files in the USI++ library should include the files needed in
the following order:


"config.h"		if necessary	
"usi-structs.h"		which gives all needed protocol-headers
		        and types (also includes sys/types.h)
"<class>.h"		(datalink.h) to get the inherited-from types

<...>			other stuff needed, i.e. <string.h> etc.
