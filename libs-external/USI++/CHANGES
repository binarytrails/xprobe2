1.93
----

    * bugfix in TCP: now the correct length of received segment is
      returned when processed TCP-options -- TCP options doesnt
      count as data and therefore TCP::sniffpack() returns only
      lenght of data contained, not including TCP headder or options
    * bugfix: in_cksum() now correctly distinguishs between IP,ICMP and
      UDP,TCP checksums (TCP+UDP may be padded in odd case, ICMP not)


1.92
----

    * Added timeout() functions

    * Added broadcast capability

    * Added experminetal get_{tcp,ip,udp}hdr

    * Added INADDR_ANY as src-IP when gethostname() fails
      this is OK for IP and ICMP packets but breaks with UDP/TCP
      b/c of its chksum calculated over pseudo-hdr because src-IP is
      involved.

    * Added	Pcap::pcap() for more flexibility

    * Began to change naming policy for internal data. Does not affect
      exported symbols.

1.90
----
   
    * introduced Layer2/RX/TX concept
    
1.68
----
    * small fixes for UDP checksum
    
1.67 Alpha
----------

    * NetBSD compilationtests
    * Added sending Datalink for Linux
    * ARP-spoofing possible now
    * copy-constructor for Datalink, IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP
    * removed pcap-headers
    * all methods which requiere a length-field, have this filed
      of type size_t
    * migration to CVS
    
1.66
----

    * Big Endian TCP-options bugfix
    * changed set_totlen() behaivior. It's not yet possible to
      modify totlen field in IP-header
    * Much stronger TCP-options code now
    
1.65
----

    * IP/TCP-options bugfix

1.64
----

    * OpenBSD port
    * added TCP-options: EOL, NOP, timestamp, mss and wscale (alpha!)
    * internal cleanups
    * set_hlen() and get_hlen from IP-class now set/return the number
      of 32-Bit words. So when you earlier did ip->get_hlen() and got 20
      you will now get 5.
    * separated the classes 
    * put all classes into namespace usipp.
    
    
1.63
----

    * ARP-class bugfix
    * Datalink {} now can be used to sniff on the datalink directly.
      (you are able to set a filter in the constructor now)
    * Bugfix for hostbyteordered tot_len and frag_off for BSD.
    * added USI_VERSION #define so you can obtain version
      of libUSI++

1.62 
----

    * WoW! Defragmentation is done now!
    * lots of internal cleanups
    * hwaddr-fix


1.60
----

    * new class Datalink {} added
    * icmpId - bugfix
    * set/getMAC functions added (experimental!)
    * ARP class added
    * libusi++ is faster now
    * fixed some memory-leaks
    * new syntax for IP::get_src/IP::get_dst
    * full PPP-support


1.50
----

    * added PPP-handling (works fine with 2 connected PC's via nullmodemcable,
      indeed it has datalink of DLT_RAW :-)
    * tcp_sniff is now able to record logins that come from X-terminals
    * much better HTML-docu
    * better/more flexible error-handling
